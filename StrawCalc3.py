#Purpose: I teach after school architecture classes
#to elementary school kids. One project was they had
#to construct geodesic domes out of straws. Each side
#of the dome is a hexagon with a total of 14 sides to
#complete the dome. Each side is constructed out of 
#triangles, 3 straws per triangle
#Goes with exercise 3

#Use print statements to briefly explain word problem
print "This geodesic dome will have 14 sides."
print "Each side is a hexagon made up of 6 triangles."

#Use print statement to pose the first question
print "If 3 straw make one triangle, how many straws are needed for the whole project?"

#First calculate the number of straws in a side
print 3 * 6, "straws. This is how many straws are needed per side."

#Next take that first equation and multiply it by 14
print (3 * 6) * 14,"straw. This is how many straws are needed for the whole project."

#Now formulate a different question
print "How many triangles are needed for the whole dome?"

#Explain the solution
print "Well there are 6 triangles per side and 14 sides total therefore,"
print "6 x 14 =",6 * 14

#Last question
print "How many triangles are in half of the dome?"
#print solution
print "6 x 7 =",6 * 7
