#Creating a statement to count my chickens
print "I will now count my chickens:"
#Calculate the hens while trying floating numbers and
#trying the round function
print "Hens", round(25.8 + 30.2 / 6.2, 2)
#Calculate the Roosters
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

#Creating a print statement to count eggs
print "Now I will count the eggs:"
#Calculate the eggs
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

#Create print statement about validity of equation
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"
#Test equation that should return a boolean value
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

#Create print statement while also practicing basic addition
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2
#Create print statement while also practicing basic subtraction
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7
#Help shows the user why the statement in line 24 is False
print "Oh, that's why it's False."

#Print statement to do more
print "How about some more."

#Practice "greater than" functionality, which should return a boolean value
print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2
#Practice "greater than or equal to" functionality, which should return a boolean value
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2
#Practice "less than or equal to" functionality, which should return a boolean value
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2
