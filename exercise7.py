#characters and commenting

#Use print statements to print beginning of nursery rhyme
print "Mary had a little lamb."
#Use a string to insert into another string
print "Its fleece was white as %s." % 'snow'
print "And everywhere that Mary went."

#This should produce 10 "." next to each other
print "." * 10

#Create char variables, using single quotes is more appropriate
#for smaller strings
end1 = 'C'
end2 = 'h'
end3 = 'e'
end4 = 'e'
end5 = 's'
end6 = 'e'
end7 = 'B'
end8 = 'u'
end9 = 'r'
end10 = 'g'
end11 = 'e'
end12 = 'r'
end13 = 's'

#Print all the char variables. Can't do a one-line
#print statement because it would be more than 80
#character. This is not appropriate in Python
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6,
print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12 + end13
