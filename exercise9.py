#Purpose: Practice more printing, triple quotes,
#and no format characters for variables.

#Create day variable
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
#Create a month variable using \n to create a new line
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

#Use print statements to display the newly created variables
print "Here are the days: ", days
print "Here are the months: ", months

#Use """ to print as many lines as the user desires
print"""
There's something going on here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.

#Use three double-quotes again with a T.S. Elliott quote 
print """
This is the way.
This is the way the world ends.
Not with a bang,
but with a whimper.
We are the Hollowmen.
